# Hello!
I am Scot_Survivor, a talented & skillful developer. Currently, living in the UK & study at Sixth Form where I am in Year 13. 
Assuming all goes well, attending university to study my B.Sc. Computer Science Course (specialisation in AI) at 
<a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Nottingham University<a/> come september 2022. 

# Passions
At the moment I do a lot of work on AI specifically Machine Learning. My main project is <a href="https://github.com/Gavin-Development" target="_blank">
Gavin</a>. Who is a transformer chatbot, his, currently private, API is used by other open source projects such as <a href="https://github.com/Gerald-Development" target="_blank">
Gerald</a>.

I do however have interests in other areas. Backend Webdev, Webdesign, Frontend Webdev & a little Chat App Backend Development. For my webdesign & web-development, you're best to check 
out my <a href="http://blackjack-example.herokuapp.com/index.html" target="_blank">blackjack webapp</a> hosted on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">heroku</a>.
My new & improved chat application projects are currently set to private while I work out some hiccups, however, 
you can look at <a href="https://github.com/Scot-Survivor/SecureChatApp" target="_blank">this</a> based on
<a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/chat-application-kivy-application-python-tutorial/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>
